<H3><A NAME="requirements"></A>1. Requirements</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Moodle is primarily developed in Linux using PHP, Apache and MySQL, and regularly 
    tested under Windows XP and Mac OS X environments.</p>
  <p>All you should need are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a working installation of <A HREF="http://www.php.net/">PHP</A> (version 
      4.1.0 or better), including the <A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">GD</A> 
      library for manipulating images.</li>
    <li>a working database server (<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</A> for 
      now, but soon it will support PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, Interbase, Foxpro, 
      Access, ADO, Sybase, DB2 or ODBC).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>On a Windows platform, the quickest way to satisfy these requirements is 
    to download <A HREF="http://www.phpgeek.com/">PHPTriad</A>, <A HREF="http://www.foxserv.net/">FoxServ</A>, 
    or <A HREF="http://www.easyphp.org/">EasyPHP</A> which will install Apache, 
    PHP, and MySQL for you. Make sure you enable the GD module so Moodle can process 
    images - you may have to edit php.ini and remove the comment (;) from this 
    line: 'extension=php_gd.dll'.</p>
  <p>On Mac OS X I highly recommend the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> 
    project.</p>
</blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="downloading"></A>2. Download</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are two ways to get Moodle, as a compressed package and via CVS. These 
    are explained in detail on the download page on <A HREF="http://moodle.com/">http://moodle.com/</A></p>
  <p>After downloading and unpacking the archive, or checking out the files via 
    CVS, you will be left with a directory called &quot;moodle&quot;, containing 
    a number of files and folders. </p>
  <p>You can either place the whole folder in your web server documents directory, 
    in which case the site will be located at <B>http://yourwebserver.com/moodle</B>, 
    or you can copy all the contents straight into the main web server documents 
    directory, in which case the site will be simply <B>http://yourwebserver.com</B>.</p>
</blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="site"></A>3. Site structure</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>Here is a quick summary of the contents of the Moodle folder, to help get 
    you oriented:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>config.php - the only file you need to edit to get started<br>
      version.php - defines the current version of Moodle code<BR>
      index.php - the front page of the site</p>
    <ul>
      <li>admin/ - code to administrate the whole server </li>
      <li>course/ - code to display and manage courses </li>
      <li>doc/ - help documentation for Moodle (eg this page)</li>
      <li>files/ - code to display and manage uploaded files</li>
      <li>lang/ - texts in different languages, one directory per language </li>
      <li>lib/ - libraries of core Moodle code </li>
      <li>login/ - code to handle login and account creation </li>
      <li>mod/ - all Moodle course modules</li>
      <li>pix/ - generic site graphics</li>
      <li>theme/ - theme packs/skins to change the look of the site.</li>
      <li>user/ - code to display and manage users</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><A NAME="data"></A>4. Create a data directory</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Moodle will also need some space on your hard disk to store uploaded files, 
    such as course documents and user pictures.</p>
  <p>Create a directory for this purpose somewhere <B>away</B> from the web server 
    documents directory (we don't want these files to be directly accessible from 
    the web), and ensure that the web server software has permission to write 
    to this directory. On Unix machines, this means setting the owner of the directory 
    to be something like &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;apache&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="database"></A>5. Create a database</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>You need to create an empty database (eg "moodle") in your database system 
    along with a special user (eg "moodleuser") that has access to that database 
    (and that database only. For example, don't use the "root" user for the moodle 
    database in a production system - it's a security hazard). </p>
  <p>eg for MySQL: </p>
  <PRE>
   # mysql -u root -p
   > CREATE DATABASE moodle; 
   > GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP,INDEX,ALTER ON moodle.* 
           TO moodleuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword'; 
   > quit 
   # mysqladmin -p reload
</PRE>
  <p>(For MySQL I highly recommend the use of <a href="http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net/">phpMyAdmin</a> 
    to manage your databases).</p>
</blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="webserver" id="webserver"></A>6. Check your web server settings</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Firstly, make sure that your web server is set up to use index.php as a default 
    page (perhaps in addition to index.html, default.htm and so on).</p>
  <p>In Apache, this is done using a DirectoryIndex parameter in your httpd.conf 
    file. Mine usually looks like this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre><strong>DirectoryIndex</strong> index.php index.html index.htm </pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Just make sure index.php is in the list (and preferably towards the start 
    of the list, for efficiency).</p>
  <p>Secondly, check your PHP configuration file (usually called php.ini) and 
    make sure uploading has been turned on:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>file_uploads = On</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Most distributions of PHP have this turned on by default, but you may want 
    to check it anyway. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<H3><A NAME="config"></A>7. Edit config.php</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now you can edit the configuration file, <strong>config.php</strong>. This 
    file is used by all other files in Moodle.</p>
  <p>To start with, make a copy of config-dist.php and call it config.php. We 
    do this so that your config.php won't be overwritten in case you upgrade Moodle 
    later on. </p>
  <p>Edit config.php to specify the database details that you just defined, as 
    well as the site address, file system directory, data directory and so on. 
    The config file has detailed directions.</p>
  <p>For the rest of this installation document we will assume your site is at: 
    <u>http://example.com/moodle</u></p>
</blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="admin"></A>8. Go to the admin page</H3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The admin page should now be working at: http://example.com/moodle/admin. 
    If you try and access the front page of your site you'll be taken there automatically 
    anyway. The first time you access this admin page, you will be presented with 
    a GPL agreement which you need to agree with to continue with the setup.</p>
  <p>Now Moodle will start setting set up your database. Firstly, the main database 
    tables are created. You should see a number of SQL statements followed by 
    status messages (in green or red) that look like this:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>CREATE TABLE course ( id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment, category 
      int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0', password varchar(50) NOT NULL default 
      '', fullname varchar(254) NOT NULL default '', shortname varchar(15) NOT 
      NULL default '', summary text NOT NULL, format tinyint(4) NOT NULL default 
      '1', teacher varchar(100) NOT NULL default 'Teacher', startdate int(10) 
      unsigned NOT NULL default '0', enddate int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default 
      '0', timemodified int(10) unsigned NOT NULL default '0', PRIMARY KEY (id)) 
      TYPE=MyISAM</p>
    <p><FONT COLOR="#006600">SUCCESS</FONT></p>
    <p>...and so on, followed by: <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Main databases set up 
      successfully</FONT>. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you don't see these, then there must have been some problem with the database 
    or the configuration settings you defined in config.php. Check that PHP isn't 
    in a restricted "safe mode" (commercial web hosts often have safe mode turned 
    on). You can check PHP variables by creating a little file containing &lt? 
    phpinfo ?&gt and looking at it through a browser. Check all these and try 
    this page again.</p>
  <p>Scroll down the very bottom of the page and press the &quot;Continue&quot; 
    link.</p>
  <p>Next you will see a similar page that sets up all the tables required by 
    each Moodle module. As before, they should all be green, otherwise you may 
    be a problem in the module code.</p>
  <p>Scroll down the very bottom of the page and press the &quot;Continue&quot; 
    link.</p>
  <p>You should now see a form where you can define more parameters for your Moodle 
    site, such as the name, the description shown on the front page, and so on. 
    Fill this out (you can always go back and change these later) and then press 
    &quot;Save changes&quot;.</p>
  <p>Finally, you will then be asked to create a top-level administration user 
    for future access to the admin pages. Fill out the details with your own name, 
    email etc and then click &quot;Save changes&quot;. Not all the fields are 
    required, but if you miss any important fields you'll be re-prompted for them. 
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Make sure you remember the username and password you chose 
              for the administration user account, as they will be necessary to 
              access the administration page in future.</strong></p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Once successful, you will be returned to the main admin page, which contain 
    a number of links arranged in a menu (these items also appear on the home 
    page when you are logged in as the admin user). All your further administration 
    of Moodle can now be done using this menu, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>creating and deleting courses</li>
    <li>creating and editing user accounts</li>
    <li>administering teacher accounts</li>
    <li>changing site-wide settings like themes etc</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="cron"></A>9. Set up cron</H3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Some of Moodle's modules require continual checks to perform tasks. For example, 
    Moodle needs to check the discussion forums so it can mail out copies of posts 
    to people who have subscribed.</p>
  <p>The script that does all this is located in the admin directory, and is called 
    cron.php. However, it can not run itself, so you need to set up a mechanism 
    where this script is run regularly (eg every five minutes). This provides 
    a &quot;heartbeat&quot; so that the script can perform functions at periods 
    defined by each module.</p>
  <p>Test that the script works by running it directly from your browser:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <PRE>http://example.com/moodle/admin/cron.php</PRE>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, you need to set up some of way of running the script automatically and 
    regularly. </p>
  <H4> Running the script from a command line</H4>
  <p>You can call the page from the command line just as you did in the example 
    above. For example, you can use a Unix utility like 'wget':</p>
  <blockquote>
    <PRE>wget -q -O /dev/null http://example.com/moodle/admin/cron.php</PRE>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note in this example that the output is thrown away (to /dev/null).</p>
  <p>The same thing using lynx:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>lynx -dump http://example.com/moodle/admin/cron.php &gt; /dev/null</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Alternatively you could use a standalone version of PHP, compiled to be run 
    on the command line. The advantage with doing this is that your web server 
    logs aren't filled with constant requests to cron.php. The disadvantage is 
    that you need to have access to a command-line version of php.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <PRE>/opt/bin/php /web/moodle/admin/cron.php


(Windows) C:\apache\php\php.exe C:\apache\htdocs\moodle\admin\cron.php

</PRE>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Automatically running the script every 5 minutes</h4>
  <p>On Unix systems: Use <B>cron</B>. Edit your cron settings from the commandline 
    using &quot;crontab -e&quot; and add a line like:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <PRE>*/5 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://example.com/moodle/admin/cron.php</PRE>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On Windows systems: The simplest way is to use my package <A TITLE="Click to download this package (150k)" HREF="http://moodle.com/download/moodle-cron-for-windows.zip">moodle-cron-for-windows.zip</A> 
    which makes this whole thing very easy.</p>
  <p>Other platforms: you will need to find another way to do this (please let 
    me know so I can update this documentation).<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<H3><A NAME="course"></A>10. Create a new course</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now that Moodle is running properly, you can create a course. </p>
  <p>Select &quot;Create a new course&quot; from the Admin page (or the admin 
    links on the home page).</p>
  <p>Fill out the form, paying special attention to the course format. You don't 
    have to worry about the details too much at this stage, as everything can 
    be changed later by the teacher.</p>
  <p>Press &quot;Save changes&quot;, and you will be taken to a new form where 
    you can assign teachers to the course. You can only add existing user accounts 
    from this form - if you want to create a new teacher account then either ask 
    the teacher to create one for themselves (see the login page), or create one 
    for them using the &quot;Add a new user&quot; on the Admin page.</p>
  <p>Once done, the course is ready to customise, and is accessible via the &quot;Courses&quot; 
    link on the home page.</p>
  <p>See the &quot;<A HREF="teacher.html">Teacher Manual</A>&quot; for more details 
    on course-building.</p>
