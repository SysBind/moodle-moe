<H2>Future</H2>
<P>I'm committed to continuing my work on Moodle and on keeping it Open and Free. 
  I have a deeply-held belief in the importance of unrestricted education and 
  empowered teaching, and Moodle is the main way I can contribute to the realisation 
  of these ideals. 
<P>As Moodle gains in maturity, I hope its directions are influenced by the community 
  of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features and their status 
  can be found at <A TARGET=_top HREF="http://bugs.moodle.org/">bugs.moodle.org</A>. 
  Your <a href="developer.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome. 
<P>Now that 1.0 has been released, most of my efforts will concentrate on the 
  macro level (supporting larger classes and integrating into larger institutions) 
  and the micro level (improving support for decisions and processes, for both 
  teachers and learners).
