<H2>Future</H2>
<P>I'm committed to continuing my work on Moodle and on keeping it Open and Free.
   I have a deeply-held belief in the importance of unrestricted 
   education, and Moodle is the main way I can contribute to these ideals.
<P>As Moodle gains in maturity, I hope its directions are influenced 
   by the community of developers and users.  A dynamic database of proposed 
   features and their status can be found at <A TARGET=_top HREF="http://bugs.moodle.org/">bugs.moodle.org</A>. 
   Your contributions in the form of ideas, code, feedback and promotion are all very welcome.
