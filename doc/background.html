<P>Right now, Moodle is still in early development. Some features are unfinished, 
  and there is a way to go yet before it could be compared to commercial tools 
  such as WebCT or Blackboard.</P>
<P>That said, it has already been used to successfully conduct a postgraduate 
  course at Curtin University of Technology, and many improvements are planned 
  in the near future.</P>
