<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Type de devoir</B></P>

<P>Il y a plusieurs types de devoirs.</P>

<P><B>Activité hors ligne</B> - this is useful when the assignment is performed outside
of Moodle.  Students can see a description of the assignment, but can't upload files or anything.
Teachers can grade all students though, and students will see notifications of their grades.

<P><B>Envoi d'un fichier unique</B> - this type of assignment allows all students to upload a 
single file, of any type.  This might be a Word processor document, or an image, a 
zipped web site, or anything you ask them to submit.  Teachers can grade submitted 
assignments online.
