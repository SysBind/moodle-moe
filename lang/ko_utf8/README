Korean
------

The Korean Moodle Translation Project is a collaborative effort led by Timothy  Allen of Hannam University. 

There are two Korean language packs in Moodle: this one is "ko_utf8" and has a  unicode UTF-8 encoding.  It would be appropriate for courses in which mutliple languages are likely to be used.  

Due to the planned shift of Moodle to unicode this language will soon supersede the "ko" pack which has a EUC-KR encoding and which is appropriate only for sites in which Korean is the only or pre-dominant language used. This "ko_utf8" unicode language pack is now the default language pack for Korean Moodle and users are encouraged to use it rather than the other one.

Project Contributors include:

Current state of the project:
-----------------------------
Finally the screen interface is virtually 100% complete.  The next priority is to correct errors in the completed translation and to finish translating the help and documentation files.  There is always a need for collaborators.  If you have any time to volunteer to help finish the translation as soon as possible please do not hesitate to contact me! (contact details below)
