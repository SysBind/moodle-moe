<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Writing</B></P>

(this is a draft help file, please do not translate yet)

<P>When writing text for others to read, keep your audience in mind.</P>

<P>Explain your ideas as clearly as you can to help avoid misunderstandings. 

   In the forums you can achieve this by keeping your posts short and on-topic, 

   instead of one long rambling post that makes many points, it is usually 

   better to write several shorter ones (perhaps in separate forums).</P>

<P>Re-edit your text as much as necessary until you get it right.   

   Even in forum posts you have <?PHP echo ($CFG->maxeditingtime/60) ?> minutes 

   after you've posted it to go back and improve it if necessary.</P>

<P>When replying to others, try and think of interesting questions you 

   can ask them.  This will help both you and them think about the 

   issue at hand.</P>
