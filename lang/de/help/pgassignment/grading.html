<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Grading of Peer Assignments</B></P>

<P>For ease of grading a Peer Assignment is divided into a number of  
	assessment &quot;elements&quot;. Each element covers
	a particular aspect of the assignment. For each element you should
<OL>
<LI>Enter a Grade by clicking in the appropriate button or selecting an appropriate
	number from the drop down menu.
	
<LI>Enter an explaination of why you gave that grade in the Feedback box. If
	you feel that the reason is obvious then leave the box empty. Note, however,
	that the person whose work you are asessing has the opportunity to get back 
	to you and may well query a grade if there is no explaination.
</OL>

<P>The last box on this form allows you to make a general comment on the 
	work. This should justify your assessment. It should be polite and as far as
	possible constructive.

<P>Note that not all the assessment elements may be counted equally. The
	higher their &QUOT;Weight&quot; the higher they count when calculating 
	the overall grade. 

<P>You may find that once you have assessed several pieces of work, you want
	to re-assess one or two of them. This is allowed and, indeed, this is good idea as
	it will give your asessments a greater consistency.
