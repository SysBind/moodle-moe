<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Resubmitting assignments</B></P>

<P>By default, students cannot resubmit assignments once the teacher has graded them</P>

<P>If you turn this option on, then students will be allowed to resubmit assignments
   after they have been graded (for you to re-grade).  This may be useful if the 
   teacher wants to encourage students to do better work in an iterative process.</P>

<P>Obviously, this option is only relevant during the submission phase of a peer graded
	assignment. During the peer grading phase the grading is always done iteratively, the student
	whose work is being graded has the opportunity to disagree with the set of 
	comments (and possibly grades) on their work and send a reply back to the student 
	doing the grading. This process continues until agreement is reached...
