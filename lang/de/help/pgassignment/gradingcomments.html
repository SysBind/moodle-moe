<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Grading the Peer Comments</B></P>

<P>This screen is used to enter the teacher's grades for the comments made
	by the students during the peer grading phase of the assignment. A relatively
	simple grading is used, the score out of 20. The treacher can decide what is
	being graded and the relative scores from the instructions given to the students
	before the peer grading started. For example, at a higher level the students may be
	required to give critical comments, at an intermediate level the students may be
	required to point out strengths and weaknesses, and at a lower level the students 
	may be simply pointing out errors and inaccuracies.
	
<P>The comments are grouped together by submission, that is each set of 
	comments refers to the same piece of work. If available the teacher's own 
	comments are shown first as a kind of benchmark.

<P>Note that this screen can be used iteratively and there is no need to grade all
	the comments in one go. Indeed it may be desirable to regrade some of the
	comments once the &quot;standard&quot; of the comments has been established.
	
<P>The grades of comments that have been scored are
	saved by clicking on the apprpriate button at the foot of the page. Once the
	teacher is happy with all the comment grades the next step is to calculate
	the Final Grades.
