<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Specimen Grading Form</B></P>

<P>This page shows shows the details of the actual form used to grade
	your assignment. It will be used by the teacher to grade your work. Further,
	in a peer graded asignment, the same form will be used by yourself and
	your fellow students to grade the submitted pieces of work.

<P>Please note that although you can change the grades and add text on 
	this form these changes are NOT saved. This is simply a specimen form, 
	but a very similar form will be used by the teacher and by you during this 
	assignment.
