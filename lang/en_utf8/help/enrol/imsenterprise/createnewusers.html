<p align="center"><b>Automatic creation of user accounts</b></p>

<p>IMS Enterprise enrolment data typically describes a set of users. If this setting is turned on, accounts can be created for any users not found in Moodle's database.</p>

<p>Users are searched for first by their "idnumber", and second by their Moodle username.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Passwords</b></p>
<p>Passwords are not imported by the IMS Enterprise plugin. We recommend using Moodle's authentication plugins to authenticate users.</p>
