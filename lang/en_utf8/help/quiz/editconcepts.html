<h1>Basic ideas of making quizzes</h1>
<p>The main concepts while managing quiz content (questions) are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quiz and pages</li>
    <li>Question bank and its categories</li>
    <li>Random question</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of a <strong>quiz</strong>, in essence, to be like a
traditional pen&amp;paper quiz (or an exam/test). It contains questions.
You can divide the questions in a quiz on several <strong>pages</strong>
or you can keep them all on one page.
With Moodle Quiz, you can also give the grading beforehand for the
questions in a quiz (as well as the total for the entire quiz).</p>
<p>When you create questions, they are stored in the <strong>Question
Bank</strong>. In the Question Bank you can create categories, which are similar
to folders. You can use them to create a hierarchy for organizing
questions, for example, by topic. When you create a question into
an exam, a copy of it is stored in the Question Bank. If you decide to
remove your question from an exam, it will still be intact in the
question bank until you delete it from there, too.</p>
<p>You can use <strong>Random Questions</strong>, if you want a question to
vary between different attempts students make at the quiz (for example,
to avoid cheating by means of students copying questions to each other).
Just create a random question in the quiz and add questions in the
category of the random question.</p>
