<p align="center"><b>Overall feedback</b></p>

<p>The overall feedback is some text that is shown to a student after
they have completed an attempt at the quiz. The text that is shown
can depend on the grade the student got.</p>

<p>For example, if you type "Well done" into the first feedback box, type 40% 
in the first grade boundary box, and type "Please study this week's work again"
in the second feedback box, then students who score 40% or better will see the 
"Well done" message, and students who score less than 40% will see the other message.</p>

<p>The grade boundaries can be specified either as a percentage, for example "31.41%", or 
as a number, for example "7". If your quiz is out of 10 marks, a grade boundary of 7 means
7/10 or better.</p>
