   <LI>An email will be immediately sent to your email address.
   <LI>Read your email, and click on the web link it contains.
   <LI>Your account will be confirmed and you will be logged in.
   <LI>Now, select the course you want to participate in.
   <LI>If you are prompted for a &quot;enrolment key&quot; - use the one
   that your teacher has given you. This will &quot;enrol&quot; you in the
   course.
   <LI>You can now access the full course. From now on you will only need
   to enter your personal username and password (in the form on this page)
