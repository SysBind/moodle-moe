<p class="normaltext">This page contains some of the most frequently asked questions 
  with their answers. If you have a problem it may be quickest to check this page 
  first.</p>
<p class="normaltext">If you don't find the answer here try the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/index.php?id=5">Using 
  Moodle</a> course on moodle.org, and search the forums for keywords. You may 
  have to try a few different search phrases before you find a resolution.</p>
<p class="normaltext">If you still can't find any answers try posting your question 
  on the appropriate forum in <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/index.php?id=5">Using 
  Moodle</a> - someone should be able to help you.</p>
<p class="normaltext">Most questions people have are related to installation, 
  and most of these are related to the editing of config.php file. Following the 
  <a href="http://moodle.org/doc/?file=install.html">installation instructions</a> 
  carefully will usually result in a perfectly working system. Here are some of 
  the most common problems that are encountered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="normaltext"><a href="#php">PHP - is it installed and what version 
    do I have?</a></p>
  <p class="normaltext"><a href="#blankpages">Why are all my pages blank?</a> 
  </p>
  <p class="normaltext"><a href="#errorgetstring">My pages show fatal errors such 
    as : call to undefined function: get_string()</a></p>
  <p class="normaltext"><a href="#headerssent">Why do I keep getting error messages 
    about &quot;headers already sent&quot;?</a></p>
  <p class="normaltext"><a href="#failedopen">I keep getting this error: Failed 
    opening required '/web/moodle/lib/setup.php'</a></p>
  <p class="normaltext"><a href="#filenotfound">Whenever I try to access or view 
    a file that I uploaded, I get an error &quot;File not Found&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="question"><a name="php"></a>PHP - is it installed and what version 
  do I have?</h4>
<div class="answer"> 
  <p>Make a new file on your web site called info.php, containing the following 
    text, and call it from your browser:</p>
    
  <pre>      &lt;?PHP phpinfo() ?&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="answer">If nothing happens then you don't have PHP installed. See the 
  installation docs for some information about where to download it for your computer.</p>
<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="question"><a name="blankpages"></a>Why are all my pages blank? </h4> 
<p class="answer">Check the dirroot and/or dataroot in config.php. You must use 
  complete, absolute pathnames:</p>
<p class="answer"> eg &nbsp$CFG->dirroot = "d:\inetpub\sites\www.yoursite.com\web\moodle";</p>
<p class="answer"> eg&nbsp $CFG->dataroot = "d:\inetpub\sites\www.yoursite.com\database\moodle";</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h4 class="question"><a name="errorgetstring"></a>My pages show fatal errors such 
  as : call to undefined function: get_string()</h4>
<p class="answer">If you see errors like:</p>
<p class="answer">Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_VARIABLE in c:\program 
  files\easyphp\www\moodle\config.php on line 94 <br>
  Fatal error: Call to undefined function: get_string() in c:\program files\easyphp\www\moodle\mod\resource\lib.php 
  on line 11</p>
<p class="answer">then it's likely you have left out a semi-colon or ending quote 
  from a line in config.php (previous to line 94).</p>
<p class="answer">Another reason could be that you have opened config.php in a 
  program like Word to edit it, and saved it as a HTML web page, instead of a 
  proper text file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="question"><a name="headerssent"></a>Why do I keep getting error messages 
  about &quot;headers already sent&quot;?</h4>
<p class="answer">If you see errors like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p class="answer">Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already sent 
    by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/lib/moodlelib.php 
    on line 1322 </p>
  <p class="answer"> Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 
    sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/lib/moodlelib.php 
    on line 1323 </p>
  <p class="answer"> Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 
    sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/login/index.php 
    on line 54 </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="answer">You have blank lines or spaces after the final ?> in your config.php 
  file. Sometimes text editors add these - for example Notepad on Windows - so 
  you may have to try a different text editor to remove these spaces or blank 
  lines completely. </p>
<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="question"><a name="failedopen"></a>I keep getting this error: Failed 
  opening required '/web/moodle/lib/setup.php'</h4>
<p class="answer">In your config.php, the setting that you use for the dirroot 
  variable must be the <strong>complete path from the root of your server's hard 
  drive</strong>.</p>
<p class="answer">Sometimes people only use the path from their home directory, 
  or relative to the root of the web server directory.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h3 class="question"><a name="filenotfound"></a>Whenever I try to access or view 
  a file that I uploaded, I get an error &quot;File not Found&quot;</h3>
<p class="answer">For example: Not Found: The requested URL /moodle/file.php/2/myfile.jpg 
  was not found on this server. </p>
<p class="answer">Your web server needs to be configured to allow the part of 
  the URL after a script name to be passed directly to the script. This is usually 
  enabled in Apache 1, but is usually disabled by default in Apache 2. To turn 
  it on, add this line to your httpd.conf, or to a .htaccess file in your local 
  directory (see the <a href="./?file=install.html#webserver">Install documentation</a> 
  for more details): </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
     <span class="answer"><b>AcceptPathInfo</b> on</span></pre>
</blockquote>
<p class="answer">Note, this will ONLY work for Apache versions 2.x. </p>
<p class="answer">If you are not using Apache 2 and you still have this problem 
  (unlikely) then you can switch Moodle to use an alternative method. The disadvantages 
  are a slight loss of performance for your users and you won't be able to use 
  relative links within HTML resources. </p>
<p class="answer">To use this alternative method: login as Admin, go into the 
  "Configure Variables" page and change the setting for "<b>slasharguments</b>". 
  You should now be able to access your uploaded files.</p>
