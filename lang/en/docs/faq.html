<h3 class="question"><a name="filenotfound"></a>Whenever I try to access or view 

  a file that I uploaded, I get an error &quot;File not Found&quot;</h3>

<p class="answer">For example: Not Found: The requested URL /moodle/file.php/2/myfile.jpg 

  was not found on this server. </p>

<p class="answer">Your web server needs to be configured to allow the part of 

  the URL after a script name to be passed directly to the script. This is usually 

  enabled in Apache 1, but is usually disabled by default in Apache 2. To turn 

  it on, add this line to your httpd.conf, or to a .htaccess file in your local 

  directory (see the <a href="./?file=install.html#webserver">Install documentation</a> 

  for more details): </p>

<p class="answercode"><b>AcceptPathInfo</b> on</p>

<p class="answer">Note, this will ONLY work for Apache versions 2.x. </p>

<p class="answer">If you are not using Apache 2 and you still have this problem 

  (unlikely) then you can switch Moodle to use an alternative method. The disadvantages 

  are a slight loss of performance for your users and you won't be able to use 

  relative links within HTML resources. </p>

<p class="answer">To use this alternative method: login as Admin, go into the 

  "Configure Variables" page and change the setting for "<b>slasharguments</b>". 

  You should now be able to access your uploaded files.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>

  

  <h4 class="question"><a name="php"></a>PHP - is it installed and what version 

  do I have?</h4>

  <p class="answer">Make a new file on your web site called info.php, containing the following 

    text, and call it from your browser:</p>

    

  <p class="answercode">&lt;?PHP phpinfo() ?&gt;</p>

<p class="answer">If nothing happens then you don't have PHP installed. See the 

  installation docs for some information about where to download it for your computer.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="question"><a name="blankpages"></a>Why are all my pages blank? </h4> 

<p class="answer">Check the dirroot variable in config.php. You must use complete, 

  absolute pathnames, eg:</p>

<p class="answercode"> $CFG->dirroot = "d:\inetpub\sites\www.yoursite.com\web\moodle";</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<h4 class="question"><a name="errorgetstring"></a>My pages show fatal errors such 

  as : call to undefined function: get_string()</h4>

<p class="answer">If you see errors like:</p>

<p class="answercode">Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_VARIABLE in c:\program 

  files\easyphp\www\moodle\config.php on line 94 <br>

  Fatal error: Call to undefined function: get_string() in c:\program files\easyphp\www\moodle\mod\resource\lib.php 

  on line 11</p>

<p class="answer">then it's likely you have left out a semi-colon or ending quote 

  from a line in config.php (previous to line 94).</p>

<p class="answer">Another reason could be that you have opened config.php in a 

  program like Word to edit it, and saved it as a HTML web page, instead of a 

  proper text file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="question"><a name="headerssent"></a>Why do I keep getting error messages 

  about &quot;headers already sent&quot;?</h4>

<p class="answer">If you see errors like this:</p>

<p class="answercode">Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 

  sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/lib/moodlelib.php 

  on line 1322 </p>

<p class="answercode"> Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 

  sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/lib/moodlelib.php 

  on line 1323 </p>

<p class="answercode"> Warning: Cannot add header information - headers already 

  sent by (output started at /webs/moodle/config.php:87) in /webs/moodle/login/index.php 

  on line 54 </p>

<p class="answer">You have blank lines or spaces after the final ?> in your config.php 

  file. Sometimes text editors add these - for example Notepad on Windows - so 

  you may have to try a different text editor to remove these spaces or blank 

  lines completely. </p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="question"><a name="failedopen"></a>I keep getting this error: Failed 

  opening required '/web/moodle/lib/setup.php'</h4>

<p class="answer">In your config.php, the setting that you use for the dirroot 

  variable must be the <strong>complete path from the root of your server's hard 

  drive</strong>.</p>

<p class="answer">Sometimes people only use the path from their home directory, 

  or relative to the root of the web server directory.</p>

<p class="answer">&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="question"><a name="quotes" id="quotes"></a>Any text I add with an apostrophe 

  (') or a quote (&quot;) causes errors or comes up with a slash added</h4>

<p class="answer">Problems caused by apostrophes are caused by incorrect &quot;magic 

  quotes&quot; settings. Moodle requires the following settings (which are usually 

  the default):</p>

<p class="answercode">magic_quotes_gpc = On<br>

  magic_quotes_runtime = Off</p>

<p class="answer">See the section on <a href="http://moodle.org/doc/?file=install.html#webserver">webserver 

  configuration</a> in the Installation docs for more details.</p>







<h4 class="question"><a name="sessiontmp"></a>I keep getting error messages about session_start</h4>

<p class="answer">If you see errors like this:</p>

<p class="answercode">Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: open(/tmp\sess_d40f380d37d431fc1516e9a895ad9ce0, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php on line 123</p>

<p class="answercode">Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: open(/tmp\sess_d40f380d37d431fc1516e9a895ad9ce0, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) in G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php on line 123</p>

<p class="answercode">Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent (output started at G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php:1) in G:\web\moodle\lib\setup.php on line 123</p>



<p class="answer">... these are all related to the fact that PHP is failing to save 

  "session" files on your hard disk (in a directory called /tmp).  Usually the 

  reason is that you don't HAVE a directory called /tmp on your computer.  This 

  is usually the case with Windows installations.



<p class="answer">The solution is to fix the PHP setting for this path to point to a real directory.  You can do this in your php.ini file:</p>

<p class="answercode">session.save_path = C:\temp</p>

<p class="answer">or otherwise in a .htaccess file in your main moodle directory:</p>

<p class="answercode">php_value session.save_path "/home/moodle/sessions"</p>



<h4 class="question"><a name="fixdirroot"></a>When I go to the admin page, I get told to make dirroot blank!</h4>

<p class="answer">If you see errors like this in Moodle 1.0.9:</p>



<table class=generalbox cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=5 align=center border=0>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td bgColor=#ffbbbb>Please fix your settings in config.php: 

<p>You have: 

<p>$CFG-&gt;dirroot = "/home/users/fred/public_html/moodle"; 

<p>but it should be: 

<p>$CFG-&gt;dirroot = "";</p></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p class="answer">then you have encountered a small bug that occurs on some servers. The problem is with the error-checking mechanism, not with your actual path.  To fix it, find this line (line 66) in the file admin/index.php: </p>

<p class="answercode">if ($dirroot != $CFG->dirroot) {</p>

<p class="answer">and change it to this:</p>

<p class="answercode">if (!empty($dirroot) and $dirroot != $CFG->dirroot) {</p>


<h4 class="question"><a name="loginsetting"></a>I login but don't appear to be. I am logged in and can navigate freely.</h4>

<p class="answer">Make sure the URL in your $CFG->wwwroot setting is exactly the same as the one you are actually using to access the site.</p>

<h4 class="question"><a name="resource1"></a>When trying to add a resource I receive error messages.</h4>

<p class="answer">Assuming you are using Apache, then it's quite likely that your setting in config.php for $CFG->wwwroot is different from the actual URL you are using to access the site. Also try turning off "secureforms" in the admin settings.</p>
