<h3>Cannot access uploaded files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Question:</b>  I have a strange problem with my new installation of Moodle. Whenever I try 
to access or view an uploaded resource, whether in the "Files" menu or on the course page, 
I get a 404 error like this one:
<blockquote>
Not Found<br>
The requested URL /moodle/file.php/2/myfile.jpg was not found on this server. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Some web servers don't support this method of passing arguments to a script.</p>
<p>As Admin, go into the "Configure Variables" page and change the setting for 
   "slasharguments".  You should now be able to access your uploaded files.</p>
