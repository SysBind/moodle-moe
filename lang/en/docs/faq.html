<h3>Cannot access uploaded files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Question:</b>  I have a strange problem with my new installation of Moodle. Whenever I try 
to access or view an uploaded resource, whether in the "Files" menu or on the course page, 
I get a 404 error like this one:
<blockquote>
Not Found<br>
The requested URL /moodle/file.php/2/myfile.jpg was not found on this server. 
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p><b>Answer:</b> Your web server needs to be configured to allow the part of the URL 
after a script name to be passed directly to the script.  This is 
usually enabled in Apache 1, but is usually disabled by default in 
Apache 2.  To turn it on, add these lines to your httpd.conf, or to 
a .htaccess file in your local directory (see the 
<A HREF="./?file=install.html#webserver">Install documentation</A> for more details): 

<blockquote>
<pre>
     <b>AcceptPathInfo</b> on
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Note, this will only work for Apache versions 2.x.

<p>If you are not using Apache 2 and you still have this problem (unlikely) then you 
   can switch Moodle to use an alternative method.  The disadvantages are a slight loss of 
   performance for your users and you won't be able to use relative links 
   within HTML resources.
<p>To use this alternative method: login as Admin, go into the "Configure Variables" page 
   and change the setting for "<b>slasharguments</b>".  You should now be able to 
   access your uploaded files.</p>
