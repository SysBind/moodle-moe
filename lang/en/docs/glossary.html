A website may contain several root directories each containing a seperate Moodle
installation. Your Moodle installation may be located at http://www.yoursite.com/moodle/
in which case your " dirroot " would be ie. http://www.moodle.org/moodle
<br>
If you had two Moodle sites on the same server then each would have a distinct
" dirroot "
<br>
ie. http://www.yoursite.com/school26 &amp; http://www.yoursite.com/school27

<h3 class="question"><a name="xml"></a>XML</h3>
<p class="answer">Extensible Mark-up Language is just what the name implies, extensible.
The programmer has a very wide latitude when writing XML as the programmer may
choose to add instructions as she/he writes. This is in direct opposition to
HTML which has a clearly defined and documented set of instructions available and
no freedom exists to " extend " this set of rules. Due to its' extreme
versatility XML may be the end of the evolutionary path for HTML. also see
<a href="#xhtml">XHTML</a>

</p><h3 class="question"><a name="xsl"></a>XSL</h3>
<p class="answer">Extensible Style Language is the style definition language
