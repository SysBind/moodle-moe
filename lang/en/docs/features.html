<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Moodle is an active and evolving product. This page lists just some of the 
  many features it contains:</p>
<p><strong>Overall design</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Promotes a social constructionist pedagogy (collaboration, activities, critical 
    reflection, etc)</li>
  <li>Suitable for 100% online classes as well as supplementing face-to-face learning 
  <li>Simple, lightweight, efficient, compatible, low-tech browser interface</li>
  <li>Easy to install on almost any platform that supports PHP. Requires only 
    one database (and can share it).</li>
  <li>Full database abstraction supports all major brands of database (except 
    for initial table definition)</li>
  <li>Course listing shows descriptions for every course on the server, including 
    accessibility to guests.</li>
  <li>Emphasis on strong security throughout. Forms are all checked, data validated, 
    cookies encrypted etc</li>
  <li>Most text entry areas (resources, forum postings, journal entries etc) can 
    be edited using an embedded WYSIWYG HTML editor</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Site management</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Site is managed by an admin user, defined during setup</li>
  <li>Plug-in "themes" allow the admin to customise the site colours, fonts, layout 
    etc to suit local needs</li>
  <li>Plug-in activity modules can be added to existing Moodle installations</li>
  <li>Plug-in language packs allow full localisation to any language. These can 
    be edited using a built-in web-based editor. Currently there are language 
    packs for more than <a href="http://moodle.com/download/lang/" target="_top">28 
    languages</a>.</li>
  <li>The code is clearly-written PHP under a GPL license - easy to modify to 
    suit your needs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User management</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Goals are to reduce admin involvement to a minimum, while retaining high 
    security</li>
  <li>Supports a range of authentication mechanisms through plug-in authentication 
    modules, allowing easy integration with existing systems.</li>
  <li>Standard email method: students can create their own login accounts. Email 
    addresses are verified by confirmation.</li>
  <li>LDAP method: account logins can be checked against an LDAP server. Admin 
    can specify which fields to use.</li>
  <li>IMAP, POP3, NNTP: account logins are checked against a mail or news server. 
    SSL, certificates and TLS are supported.</li>
  <li>External database: any database containing at least two fields can be used 
    as an external authentication source.</li>
  <li>Each person requires only one account for the whole server - each account 
    can have different access</li>
  <li>An admin account controls the creation of courses and creates teachers by 
    assigning users to courses</li>
  <li>Security - teachers can add an "enrolment key" to their courses to keep 
    out non-students. They can give out this key face-to-face or via personal 
    email etc</li>
  <li>Teachers can unenrol students manually if desired, otherwise they are automatically 
    unenrolled after a certain period of inactivity (set by the admin)</li>
  <li>Students are encouraged to build an online profile including photos, description. 
    Email addresses can be protected from display if required.</li>
  <li>Every user can specify their own timezone, and every date in Moodle is translated 
    to that timezone (eg posting dates, assignment due dates etc)</li>
  <li>Every user can choose the language used for the Moodle interface (English, 
    French, German, Spanish, Portuguese etc)</li>
</ul>
