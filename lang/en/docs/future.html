<h2>Future</h2>

<p>As Moodle gains in maturity, its directions are increasingly influenced by 
  the community of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features 
  and their status can be found at <a target=_top href="http://moodle.org/bugs/">moodle.org/bugs</a>. 
  Your <a href="?file=credits.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome - see the <a href="?file=developer.html">Developers 
  manual</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Overall development has currently slowed down a bit while Martin finishes his 
  PhD thesis.</p>

<p>Here is a rough map of the future (subject to change): 
<dl>
  <dt>Version 1.0.9 - May 29th, 2003</dt>

  <dd>This release will contain all the many new features and bug fixes accumulated 
    since 1.0.8.1.</dd>

  <dt>Version 1.1 - August 2003 ?</dt>
  <dd>This release will tie up some other loose ends and new modules such as 'chat' 
    and the 'issue tracker'. It will probably include new features for backing 
    up and restoring individual courses. It may have support for groups and group 
    work. </dd>

<dt>Version 2.0  - December 2003 ?</dt>
<dd>This major release will include some major changes in internal structure
    designed to add flexibility and scalability in many areas.  Among the major 
    targets are:
    <ul>
      <li> Stronger pedagogical support for both teachers and students 
      <li> Rewritten display layer using XHTML-compatible code and complete implementation 
        of templates for increased standards-compliance, flexibility and accessibility. 
      <li> Wider use of PHP classes in key areas of the Moodle code, to make some 
        things easier for programmers writing new modules or integrating with 
        external systems. 
      <li> New access-control system allowing finely-defined roles and rights. 
      <li> Basic support for IMS and SCORM 
      <li> Whatever else comes along :-) 
    </ul>
</dd>
