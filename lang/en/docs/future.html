<h2>Future</h2>

<p>As Moodle gains in maturity, its directions are increasingly influenced by 
  the community of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features 
  and their status can be found at <a target=_top href="http://moodle.org/bugs/">moodle.org/bugs</a>. 
  Your <a href="?file=credits.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome - see the <a href="?file=developer.html">Developers 
  manual</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Overall development has currently slowed down a bit while Martin finishes his 
  PhD thesis.</p>

<p>Here is a rough map of the future (subject to change): 
<dl>

  <dt>Version 1.1 - August 2003 ?</dt>
  <dd>The major targets for this version include:
    <ul>
    <li>Consistent, customisable grading methods throughout all modules
    <li>Support for groups/cohorts within courses
    <li>A chat module
    <li>Backup and restore of courses
    <li>Miscellaneous contributed code and bug fixes
    </ul>
  </dd>

<dt>Version 2.0  - December 2003 ?</dt>
<dd>This major release will include some major changes in internal structure
    designed to add flexibility and scalability in many areas.  Among the major 
    targets are:
    <ul>
      <li> Stronger pedagogical support for both teachers and students 
      <li> Rewritten display layer using XHTML-compatible code and complete implementation 
        of templates for increased standards-compliance, flexibility and accessibility. 
      <li> Wider use of PHP classes in key areas of the Moodle code, to make some 
        things easier for programmers writing new modules or integrating with 
        external systems. 
      <li> New access-control system allowing finely-defined roles and rights. 
      <li> Basic support for IMS and SCORM 
      <li> Better integration of Moodle with moodle.org
      <li> Whatever else comes along :-) 
    </ul>
</dd>
