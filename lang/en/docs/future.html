<H2>Future</H2>

<P>Some notes from the main author: Martin Dougiamas.</p>

<P>I'm committed to continuing my work on Moodle and on keeping it Open and Free. 
  I have a deeply-held belief in the importance of unrestricted education and 
  empowered teaching, and Moodle is the main way I can contribute to the realisation 
  of these ideals. 

<P>As Moodle gains in maturity, its directions are increasingly influenced by the community 
  of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features and their status 
  can be found at <A TARGET=_top HREF="http://moodle.org/bugs/">moodle.org/bugs</A>. 
  Your <A href="?file=developer.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome. 

<P>Currently my own involvement has slowed while I finish writing my PhD thesis.

<P>Here is a rough map of the future as I currently see it (obviously this is 
   subject to change):

<DL>
<DT>Version 1.1 - May 2003</DT>

<DD>This release will contain all the many new features and bug fixes accumulated 
    since 1.0.8.1, including new modules such peer-graded assignments.
</DD>

<DT>Version 1.2  - August 2003 ?</DT>
<DD>This release will tie up some other loose ends and new modules such as 'chat' and 'issue tracker'.
</DD>

<DT>Version 2.0  - December 2003 ?</DT>
<DD>This major release will include some major changes in internal structure
    designed to add flexibility and scalability in many areas.  Among the major 
    targets are:
    <UL>
    <LI> Stronger pedagogical support for both teachers and students
    <LI> Rewritten display layer using XHTML-compatible code and complete implementation
         of templates for increased standards-compliance, flexibility and accessibility.
    <LI> Wider use of PHP classes in key areas of the Moodle code, to make things 
         easier for programmers writing new modules or integrating with external systems.
    <LI> Support for groups and group work
    <LI> New access-control system allowing finely-defined roles and rights.
    <LI> Basic support for IMS and SCORM
    <LI> Whatever else comes along :-)
    </UL>
</DD>
