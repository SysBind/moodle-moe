<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Initial Page Name for wiki</B></P>
<P>
You can select a name to give to the initial wiki page here. This name will become the first 
page of the wiki whenever it is viewed from the course. If you do not specify a name in wiki 
'camel case' (mixed upper and lower case words, compressed together - e.g. 'WikiName'), then 
whatever you enter will be forced into camel case.<br><br>

If you leave this field blank, the initial page name will be the wiki name, unless you select
a page in the 'initial page' field.
