This module, the &quot;HotPot&quot; module, allows teachers to administer <A href="http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/" target="_blank">Hot Potatoes</A> quizzes via Moodle. The quizzes are created on the teacher's computer and then uploaded to the Moodle course. </P>
<P>After students have attempted the quizzes, a number of reports are available which show how individual questions were answered and some statistical trends in the scores. </P>
