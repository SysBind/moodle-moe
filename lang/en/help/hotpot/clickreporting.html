	<dd>A separate record is stored in the database each time a 
	&quot;hint&quot;, &quot;clue&quot; or &quot;check&quot; 
	button is clicked. This allows the teacher to see a very 
	detailed report showing the state of the quiz at each click. 
	However, it may also mean that the size of the database grows 
	very quickly, because several &quot;click&quot; records may 
	be stored for each attempt at a quiz.</dd>
