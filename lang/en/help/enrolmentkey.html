<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Course Enrolment Key</B></P>

<P>A course enrolment key is what keeps unwanted people 
   out of your course.

<P>If you leave this blank, then anyone who has created 
   a Moodle username on this site will be able to enrol
   in your course.

<P>If you put something here, then students who are trying 
   to get in for the FIRST TIME ONLY will be asked to supply 
   this word or phrase.  The guest account can also get in
   to the course using the enrolment key - but it will be asked
   for the key EVERY TIME a guest logs in the course. (This occurs
   even if you have specified 'no guests are allowed')

<P>The idea is that you will supply the key to authorised 
   people using another means like private email, snail mail,
   on the phone or even verbally in a face to face class.

<P>If this password "gets out" and you have unwanted people 
   enrolling, you can unenrol them (see their user profile page)
   and change this key.  Any legitimate students who have already enrolled will
   not be affected, but the unwanted people won't be able 
   to get back in.
