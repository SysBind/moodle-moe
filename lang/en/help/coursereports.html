<p align="center"><b>Activity Reports</b></p>

<P>Activity reports are available for each partipant 
   that show what they have done in the current course.</p>

<p>Teachers always have access to these.</p>

<p>Student access to their own reports is an optional course
   setting set by the teacher.  For some courses these 
   reports can be a useful tool for a student to reflect 
   on their involvement and appearance within the online 
   environment, but for some courses this may not be 
   necessary.</p>

<p>Another reason for turning it off is that the report 
   can place a bit of load on the server while being 
   generated.  For large or long classes it may be more 
   efficient to keep it off.<p>
