<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Linking glossaries' entries with other modules automatically</B></P>

<P>If you stablish that a glossary or an entry should be automatically linked, the entries affected will be automatically linked whenever they are found in other resources (forums, comments, etc).
<p>If you do not want a specific entry to be linked, you should insert it between the &lt;nolink> and &lt;/nolink> tags in the source of the HTML.
<p>Also, if a category is found, it will also be linked. Note that category linking is case sensitive.
