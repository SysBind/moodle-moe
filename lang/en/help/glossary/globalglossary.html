<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Defining a global glossary</B></P>

<P>The glossary system allows you to define concepts that could be available in the whole site. They are called Global Glossaries.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you should specify which glossary is global.</p>

<p>You can have as many global glossaries as you want, and they can belong to any course. All other rules are also valid for global glossaries.</p>

<p>Note: Only admins can create global glossaries.</p>
