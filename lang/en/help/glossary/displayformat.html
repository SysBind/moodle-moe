<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Display format</B></P>

<P>The system has three built-in formats to display entries. You can create your own format if you want.
<p>The default view is quite simple. It looks like a conventional dictionary.
<p>The second view shows the entry in a forum-like format, without the author's data.
<p>And the third one shows the entry also in a forum-like format but with the author's data.
<hr>
<p>If you want to create your own format, you should create a .PHP file and give it a number as its name. See into mod/glossary/formats which should be the next number.
<p>Then, create a funcion called <b>glossary_print_entry_by_format($course, $cm, $glossary, $entry)</b> and dump all your creativity.
<p>The last stemp is to insert a new entry in every language pack you use called <b>displayformat[number]</b>, and give it a meaningful description.
