<P>When reading texts quickly it is often very easy to misunderstand what the 
   author was trying to say.</P>

<P>To avoid misunderstanding, read texts carefully and try to see the words
   from the author's point of view.  Be empathic.</P>

<P>It can also help to think of what the author has NOT said - this may 
   help you form questions in your own mind.</P>
