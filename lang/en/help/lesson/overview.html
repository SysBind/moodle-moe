<p align="center"><b>Overview</b></p>

<ol>
<li>A lesson is made up of a number of <b>pages</b>.
<li>A page contains some <b>content</b> and it normally ends with a <b>question</b>.
<li>Each page normally has a set of <b>answers</b>. 
<li>Each answer can have a short piece of text which is displayed if the answer is
    chosen. This piece of text is called the <b>response</b>.
<li>Also associated with each answer is a <b>jump</b>. The jump can be relative - 
    this page, next page - or absolute - specifying any one of the pages in the 
    lesson or the end of the lesson.
<li>By default, the first answer jumps to the <b>next page</b> in the lesson. 
    The subsequent answers jump to the same page. That is, the student is shown 
    the same page of the lesson again if they do not chose the first answer.
<li>The next page is determined by the lesson's <b>logical order</b>. This is 
    the order of the pages as seen by the teacher. This order can be altered 
    by moving pages within the lesson.
<li>The lesson also has a <b>navigation order</b>. This is the order of the 
    pages as seen by the students. This is determined by the jumps specified
    for individual answers and it can be very different from the logical order.
    (Although if the jumps are <i>not</i> changed from their default values
     the two are strongly related.) The teacher has the option to check the 
    navigation order.
<li>When displayed to the students, the answers are always shuffled. That is, the
    first answer from the teacher's point of view will not necessarily be the
    first answer in the list shown to the students. (Further, each time the same
    set of answers is displayed they are likely to appear in a different order.)
<li>The number of answers can vary from page to page. For example, it is allowed
    that some pages can end with a true/false question while others have questions
    with one correct answer and three, say, distractors. 
<li>It is possible to set up a page without any answers. The students are shown
    a <b>Continue</b> link instead of the set of shuffled answers.
<li>For the purposes of grading the lessons, <b>correct</b> answers are ones which 
    jump to a page which is further <i>down</i> the logical order than the current page. 
    <b>Wrong</b> answers are ones which either jump to the same page or to a page
    further <i>up</i> the logical order than the current page. Thus, if the jumps are
    <i>not</i> changed, the first answer is a correct answer and the other answers are 
    wrong answers.
<li>Questions can have more than one correct answer. For example, if two of the answers
    jump to the next page then either answer is taken as a correct answer. (Although
    the same destination page is shown to the students, the responses shown on the way 
    to that page may well be different for the two answers.)
<li>In the teacher's view of the lesson the correct answers have underlined Answer 
    Labels.
<li>The <b>end of the lesson</b> is reached by either jumping to that location explicitly 
    or by jumping to the next page from the last (logical) page of the lesson. When the
    end of the lesson is reached, the student receives a congratulations message and is 
    shown their grade. The grade is (the number of correct answers checked / number of 
    pages seen) * the grade of the lesson.
<li>If the end of the lesson is <i>not</i> reached, when the student goes into the
    lesson they are given the choice of starting at the begining or picking up the lesson
    where they answered their last correct answer.
<li> For a lesson which allow re-takes, students are allowed to re-take the lesson until
    they have achieved the maximum grade.
