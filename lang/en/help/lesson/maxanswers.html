<p align="center"><b>The Maximum Number of Answers in a Lesson</b></p>

<p>This value determines the maximum number of answers the teacher can use.
    The default value is 4. If the lesson uses only TRUE or FALSE
    questions throughout then it is sensible to set this value to 2.</p>
    
<p>It is safe to change this value in a lesson with existing content.</p>
