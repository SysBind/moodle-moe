<p align="center"><strong>Time limit</strong></p>

<p>With time limit you can control how much time student can have
on one quiz attempt. If time limit is exeeded, the quiz will be sent
automatically, with current answers. If student backs down and returns
to quiz attempt when time limit has expired, zero grade will be marked.</p>

<p>Zero value means, no time limit.</p>
