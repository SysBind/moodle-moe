<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Numerical questions</B></P>

<p>In response to a question (that may include a image) the respondent 
   must type a number.</p>

<p>The required answer may have an accepted error.  This allows a range of 
   answers to be set.</p>
   
<p>For example, if the answer is 30 with an error of 5, then any number 
   between 25 and 35 will be accepted as correct.</p>
