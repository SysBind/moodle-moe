<p align="center"><b>Random Question</b></p>

<p>When you put a random question into a quiz, then a question 
   will be chosen randomly from the category, on each attempt. Thus different students
   are likely to get a different selection of questions and furthermore for quizzes that allow
   reattempts that are not based on previous attempts, the new attempt are likely to contain a
   new selection of questions. </p>
   
<p>If you include several random questions then different questions will be chosen for each of
   them. If you mix random and non-random questions then the random questions
   will be chosen so that they do not duplicate one of the non-random questions.
   </p>

<p>The grade for the randomly chosen question will be rescaled so that the maximum grade is 
   what you have chosen as the grade for the random question.</p>
