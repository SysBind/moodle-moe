<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Activity Modules</B></P>

<P>Moodle contains a wide range of activity modules that can be used to 
   build up any type of course.</P>

<P><IMG VALIGN=absmiddle SRC="<?=$CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/forum/icon.gif">&nbsp;<B>Forums</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This activity can be the most important - it is here that most discussion takes place. 
   Forums can be structured in different ways, and can include peer rating of each posting.
   The postings can be viewed in a variety for formats, and can include attachments.  
   By subscribing to a forum, participants will receive copies of each new posting 
   in their email.  A teacher can impose subscription on everyone if they want to.

<P><IMG VALIGN=absmiddle SRC="<?=$CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/journal/icon.gif">&nbsp;<B>Journals</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This module is a very important reflective activity.  The teacher 
   asks the student to reflect on a particular topic, and the student can 
   edit and refine their answer over time.  This answer is private and
   can only be seen by the teacher, who can offer feedback and a grade 
   on each journal entry.  It's usually a good idea to have about one 
   Journal activity per week.</P>
</UL>

<P><IMG VALIGN=absmiddle SRC="<?=$CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/resource/icon.gif">&nbsp;<B>Resources</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Resources are content: information you want to bring into the 
   course.  These can be prepared files you've uploaded to the course 
   server; pages you edit directly in Moodle; or simply links to 
   external web pages that appear within this course.</P>
</UL>

<P><IMG VALIGN=absmiddle SRC="<?=$CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/assignment/icon.gif">&nbsp;<B>Assignments</B></P>
<UL>
<P>Assignments allow the teacher to specify a task that requires students 
   to prepare digital content (any format) and submit it by uploading it 
   to the server.  Typical assignments include essays, projects, reports 
   and so on.  This module includes grading facilities.</P>
</UL>

<P><IMG VALIGN=absmiddle SRC="<?=$CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/quiz/icon.gif">&nbsp;<B>Quizzes</B></P>
<UL>
<P>This module allows you to design and set quiz tests, consisting of 
   multiple choice, true-false, and short answer questions.  These 
   questions are kept in a categorised database, and can be re-used
   within courses and even between courses.  Quizzes can allow 
   multiple attempts.  Each attempt is automatically marked, and the 
   teacher can choose whether to give feedback or to show correct answers.
   This module includes grading facilities.</P>
</UL>

<P><IMG VALIGN=absmiddle SRC="<?=$CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/choice/icon.gif">&nbsp;<B>Choices</B></P>
<UL>
<P>A choice activity is very simple - you ask a question and specify a 
   choice of multiple responses.  It can be useful as a quick poll to 
   stimulate thinking about a topic, or to allow the class to vote on 
   a direction for the course, or to gather research consent.
</UL>

<P><IMG VALIGN=absmiddle SRC="<?=$CFG->wwwroot?>/mod/survey/icon.gif">&nbsp;<B>Surveys</B></P>
<UL>
<P>The Survey module provides a number of verified survey instruments that
   have been found useful in assessing and stimulating learning in 
   online environments.  Teachers can use these to gather data from their
   students that will help them learn about their classs and reflect 
   on their own teaching.</P>
