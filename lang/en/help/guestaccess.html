<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Guest Access</B></P>

<P>You have the choice of allowing "guests" into your course

<P>People can log in as guests using the "Login as a guest" button
   on the login screen.

<P>Guests have "read-only" access - meaning they can't leave 
   any posts or otherwise mess up the course for real students.

<P>This can be handy when you want to let a colleague in to 
   look around at your work, or to let students see a course before 
   they have decided to enrol.

<P>If you also set an enrolment key (usually a good idea), 
   then the guest user will be challenged to provide the 
   enrolment key EVERY TIME they log in to the course.
