<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Formatting text</B></P>

<P>When writing text in Moodle there are currently two formats you can choose
   to produce your text, depending on your expertise and the type of browser
   you are using.

<P>In most cases you can just leave this setting alone and things should
   work as you expect.

<P><B>1. Moodle auto-format</B></P>

<UL>
<P>This format is best for when you are using normal web forms for entry
   (instead of the Richtext HTML editor).  Just type text normally, as if sending
   and email (for example).

<P>When you save your text, Moodle will do a number of things to automatically
   format your text for you.  
<P>For example, URLs such as 
   <A HREF="http://yahoo.com/">http://yahoo.com</A> or even 
   <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">www.yahoo.com</A> will be turned into links.
<P>Your line breaks will be retained, and blank lines will start new paragraphs.
<P>Smiley characters such as :-) will automatically become their graphical equivalents.
<P>You can even embed HTML code if you want to and it will be retained.
<P ALIGN=RIGHT>Click <? helpbutton("text", get_string("helptext")) ?> for more details</P>
</UL>

<P><B>2. HTML format</B></P>

<UL>
<P>This format assumes the text is pure HTML.  If you are using the 
   HTML editor to edit text then this is the default format - all 
   the commands in the toolbar are producing HTML for you.

<P>Even if you are not using the Richtext HTML editor, you can use HTML code 
   in your text and it should come out exactly as you intended.

<P>Unlike the Moodle auto-format, no automatic formatting is performed.
