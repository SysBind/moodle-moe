<P>A Peer Graded Assignment is more complex than an ordinary assignment.
	It involves a number of steps or phases. These are
<OL>
<LI>The assessment of a peer assignment should be broken into a number
	of assessment ELEMENTS. This makes the grading of an assignment less
	arbitary and gives the students a framework on which to make assessments. 
	The teacher has the role of setting up the assessment elements thus making a
	grading page. (See that page for more details.)
	
<LI>With the grading page set up the assignment is made available to students.
	There is a submission deadline for the work done by the students. During this
	phase the teacher can, if desired, grade some or all of the submissions. The 
	grading need not be final, the grades are used as a guide in the next phase...

<LI>After the submission deadline has passed, the teacher moves the assignment
	to the peer grading phase. First each student is allocated a random selection 
	of the submitted pieces of work. If there is a sufficient number of <b>graded</b> 
	submissions, the system ensures that each student is allocated at least one 
	&quot;good&quot; piece of work and at least one &quot;poor&quot; piece of work.
	Each student now has a number of pieces of work to grade. This must be done
	within the &quot;Grading&quot; deadline. A student can comment on these
	assessments (made by other students) of their own peice of work and they 
	can go back for re-grading if the student is not happy with some aspect. 
	That loop continues until either the student is happy with the amended 
	assessment, the deadline for grading is reached or the teacher intervenes 
	in the process.
	
<LI>After the grading deadline has passed the teacher must grade the comments
	made by the students on submissions. This is a single grade score. Once the
	comments has be graded the teacher can calculate the final grades of the students.
	These final grades are normally made up of three components, teacher's grade,
	mean peer grade and grading performance. The later is mainly the mean score 
	entered by the teacher against a student's comments. This three components are
	first weighted before the calculation takes place.
