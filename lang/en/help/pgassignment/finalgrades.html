<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The Final Grades</B></P>

<P>The table on this screen lists the final grades and their breakdown as shown to 
	the students. If an	error is seen in the table then it is possible to &quot;go back&quot;
	and make a correction in some cases. There are a couple of possibilities.
	
<OL>
<LI>If a teacher's grade needs to be changed then the piece of work can be 
	re-graded by going 
	to the teacher's Management screen for assignment and clicking on the link &quot;View
	(n) submitted Assignments&quot;. The piece of work can be re-graded. Once this has 
	been done then the Phase 4 screen &quot;Grade Comments&quot; should be displayed AND the
	link at the foot of that page clicked so that the new final grade is stored in the
	database.
<LI>If it is desired to use a different weighting scheme then the link
	&quot;Calculate Final Grades&quot; can be clicked and the new weights entered. Clicking 
	on the button at the foot of the screen will save the adjusted weights and re-calculate
	the final scores.
