<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Peer Graded Assignment Elements</B></P>

<P>For ease of grading a Peer Graded Assignment should have a reasonable 
	number of &quot;Assessment Elements&quot;. Each element should cover
	a particular aspect of the assignment. Typically an assignment will have
	something between 5 to 15 elements for comments and grading, the 
	actual number depending on the size and complexity of the assignment. A peer 
	assignment with only one element is allowed and has a similar assessment
	strategy to the standard Moodle Assignment. Elements have 
	the following three features:
<OL>
<LI>The DESCRIPTION of the assessment element. This should clearly state what 
	aspect of the assignment is being assessed. If the assessment is qualatative
	it is helpful to give details of what is considered excellent, average 
	and poor.
	
<LI>The SCALE of the assessment element. There are a number of prefined
	scales. These range from simple Yes/No scales, through multipoint scales to
	a full percentage scale. Each element has its own scale which should be choosen
	to fit the number of possible variations for that element. Note that the scale 
	does NOT determine the element's	importance when calculating the overall 
	grade, a two point scale has the same &quot;influence&quot; as a 100 point 
	scale if the respective elements have the same weight...

<LI>The WEIGHT of the assessment element. By default the elements are given the same 
	importance when calculating the overall grade of the assignment. This can be
	changed by giving the more importance elements a weight greater than one, and
	the less important elements a weight below one. Changing the weights does NOT 
	effect the maximum grade, that value is fixed by the Maximum Grade parameter
	of the peer graded assignment.
