<P align="center"><b>Directory Paths</b></P>

<P>Directory Paths full syntax depends of your Operating System:</P>

<UL>

<LI>In <b>Windows Systems</b> they are in the form:
<UL> 
<LI>c:\program files\data\moodle
<LI>c:\documents and settings\moodle\temp\saved
</UL>

<BR />

<LI>In <b>Unix Systems</b> they are in the form: 
<UL>
<LI>/usr/data/moodle
<LI>/home/moodle/tmp/saved
</UL>

</UL>

<P>Note that some paths (in config.php, Scheduled Backups... will require 
that you specify an existing directory to work.</P>

<P>Finally, make sure the upper/lower case is correct and do not include 
a trailing slash.</P>
