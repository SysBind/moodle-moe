UPGRADING   $Id$
---------

Since the first main release of Moodle (2002080100)
most upgrading is done automatically.  See the file
version.php for all the details.

When upgrading from any previous version of Moodle, 
all you normally will need to do is this:

1)  Make a backup of your current Moodle installation 
    just in case something goes wrong and you need 
    to restore the older version.

2a) If you are using CVS, just go the root directory
    and type "cvs update -d" (or whatever the equivalent
    is on your non-Unix server).

                       OR

2b) Remove the current installation, and then unpack 
    the new installation in the same location.
    Make sure you copy the config.php file from your 
    old installion to the new installation (or make a 
    new one by editing config-dist.php).

3)  IMPORTANT: Login as the admin user and visit 
    http://your.moodle.site/admin using a web browser.

If all goes well, your databases will be upgraded to 
suit the new files, and you can go on using Moodle
normally.

If you have problems with this procedure, let me know.

Cheers,
Martin
