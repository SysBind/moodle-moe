UPGRADING   $Id$
---------

Since the first main release of Moodle (2002080100)
most upgrading is done automatically.  See the file
version.php for all the details.

When upgrading from any previous version of Moodle, 
all you normally will need to do is this:

1a) Update the source files using CVS

    or

1b) Make a backup of the current working installation 
    files, then put the new files here.  Make sure you 
    copy your old config.php back here (or make a new 
    one by editing config-dist.php).

2)  Login as the admin user and visit /admin using a 
    web browser.

If all goes well, your databases will be upgraded to 
suit the new files, and you can go on using Moodle
normally.

If you have problems, let me know.

Cheers,
Martin
