<H3> Release notes for Moodle 1.0.6 beta 1</H3>

<P>  Major changes in this release (since 1.0.5):   </P>

<UL><DL>
<DT> New feature - WYSIWYG Text editing!
<DD> A WYSIWYG text editor has been added to many of the forms in Moodle.  These are currently 
     only visible when using Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or later - other browsers see the 
     normal forms exactly as before.

<DT> New feature - Quiz module!
<DD> Finally, the most requested new module is here!  Multiple choice, short answer, and true-false
     questions with automatic marking, multiple attempts, teacher regrading and many other features.
     Questions are stored in a catagorised database, and may be "published" to other courses.

<DT> New feature - Grade manager!
<DD> A new tool has been added for teachers to see all grades for a course on one page.
     You can also download/export grades as a tab-separated text file or an Excel
     Spreadsheet.  In future more features will be added to this page like sorting, manual 
     columns and calculations, but it's still pretty useful right now.

<DT> New feature - New smilies
<DD> Many new smilies have been added, and are now also accessible using a GUI in the text editor.

<DT> Improved text editing
<DD> You can now include all major HTML tags in all texts.  This is now safe because 
     of newly added functionality that strips all Javascript and faulty tags from texts 
     before they can cause security or display problems.

<DT> Languages
<DD> German and Italian have been added!  Many thanks to the translators (see the credits).

<DT> Reading module => Resource module
<DD> After much thought and a vote of support (21 "yes" to 6 "no") on the "Using Moodle" 
     web site I changed the name of the "reading" module to "resource" (at the code level
     and also the language packs).  It was better to do this earlier than later.
     This more generic name will be more meaningful to more people and opens the way to 
     some real development on a resource library.
     But I don't want to ever change a module name again!  :-)
     If you have any hard-coded URLs pointing to readings that you don't want to break,
     you can add a line like this to your Apache httpd.conf to redirect them:
     <B><CODE>Redirect /mod/reading http://yourserver.com/mod/resource</CODE></B>

<DT> Other additions
<DD> An admin script to totally delete the Moodle data directory has been included (admin/delete.php)
     for people who need to tear down a Moodle installation but don't have root access on their
     server.

<DT> Miscellaneous
<DD> Many small improvements have been made to the interface, and many small bugs have been fixed.
     Some examples: 
     <UL>
     <LI> Big "Edit this page" buttons at the top of pages (replacing the tiny icon)
     <LI> LDAP authentication module (thanks to Petri)
     <LI> Authentication from external sources can now import any fields
     <LI> Student assignment list now shows submission status properly
     <LI> Default language for users is now the site language
     <LI> Users have a 'Change Password' button on their profile page
     <LI> Journals that need teacher feedback are highlighted
     <LI> More documentation and more context help buttons
     <LI> Database-specific upgrade code
     <LI> Uses character-set codes to make the browser do the right thing 
     <LI> User's name in footer is now a link
     </UL>
