<H3> Release notes for Moodle 1.0.5 </H3>

<P>  New features (since 1.0.4):   </P>

<UL><DL>
<DT> Configuration
<DD> Most variables are now stored in the database and modifed using an 
     admin form - this means config.php can be much shorter (only 8 items).
     The GD version is now auto-detected on all versions of PHP.  
     New authentication plug-ins are now supported (auth directory).

<DT> Language improvements
<DD> We have three new languages!  French, Finnish and Portuguese (Brazil).
     The authors are on the credits page in the Moodle documentation.
     Also, languages can now be easily edited directly via an admin web page.

<DT> Theme improvements
<DD> The standard theme code has been tidied up.  It is now easier to 
     hack them and make your own themes. Existing themes are 100% 
     compatible.  One new feature is that the home page can have a 
     different look to the other pages.  A new standardlogo theme has 
     been added that shows you how to put your logo on the front page 
     (eg like moodle.com does) 

<DT> User improvements
<DD> The user profile editing page now has a better layout.  
     The list of participants now switches to various "condensed modes" 
     when displaying larger classes.  All user listings now support 
     sorting by column.  The admin user can now delete (disable) user 
     accounts so that the user isn't displayed anywhere.  Individual 
     users can choose their own display language (so that all web pages 
     and mailouts will be in that language).

<DT> Activity improvements
<DD> The "recent activity" box now also shows journal entries and 
     submitted assignments and surveys.  The guest user can no longer 
     edit *anything* at all.  A new reading type called "HTML text" 
     allows experienced users to use pure HTML.

<DT> Miscellaneous
<DD> Many tweaks to the interface and small bugs fixed.
