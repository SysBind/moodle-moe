<H3> Release notes for Moodle 1.0.6 dev</H3>

<P>  New features (since 1.0.5):   </P>

<UL><DL>
<DT> WYSIWYG Text editing!
<DD> A WYSIWYG text editor has been added to many of the forms in Moodle.  These are currently 
     only visible when using Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or later - other browsers see the 
     normal forms exactly as before.

<DT> Quiz module!
<DD> Finally, the most requested new module is here!  Multiple choice, short answer, true-false
     quizzes with automatic marking, multiple attempts and many other features.

<DT> Grade manager!
<DD> A new tool has been added for teachers to see all grades for a course on one page.
     You can also download/export grades as a tab-separated text file or an Excel
     Spreadsheet.  In future more features will be added to this page like sorting, manual 
     columns and calculations, but it's still pretty useful right now.

<DT> New smilies
<DD> Many new smilies have been added, and are now also accessible using a GUI in the text editor.

<DT> Languages
<DD> German and Italian have been added!  Many thanks to the translators (see the credits).

<DT> Reading module ===> Resource module
<DD> After much thought and a vote of support (21 "yes" to 6 "no") on the "Using Moodle" 
     web site I changed the name of the "reading" module to "resource" (at the code level
     and also the English language pack).  Better now than later.

     This more generic name will be more meaningful to more people and opens the way to 
     some real development on a resource library.
     <BR><BR>
     I don't anticipate ever having to change a module name again!  :-)

<DT> Other additions
<DD> An admin script to totally delete the Moodle data directory has been included (admin/delete.php)
     for people who need to tear down a Moodle installation but don't have root access on their
     server.

<DT> Miscellaneous
<DD> Many small improvements have been made to the interface, and many small bugs have been fixed.
