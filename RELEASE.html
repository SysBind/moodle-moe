<H3> Release notes for Moodle 1.0.6 dev</H3>

<P>  New features (since 1.0.5):   </P>

<UL><DL>
<DT> WYSIWYG Text editing!
<DT> A WYSIWYG text editor has been added to many of the forms in Moodle.  These are currently 
     only visible when using Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or later - other browsers see the 
     normal forms exactly as before.

<DT> Quiz module
<DT> Finally, the most requested new module is here!  This first version of the quiz module as 
     it is now is still fairly basic (compared to what I'm aiming for), but I think you'll find 
     it very usable for most needs already.

<DT> New smilies
<DT> Many new smilies have been added, and are now also accessible using a GUI in the text editor.

<DT> Languages
<DD> German and Italian have been added!  Many thanks to the translators (see the credits).

<DT> Miscellaneous
<DD> Many tweaks to the interface and small bugs fixed.
