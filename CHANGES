2003-08-24 Sunday 18:44  moodler

	* backup/: restore_execute.html, restorelib.php: 
	
	Some fixes for robustness (make sure variables exist before using
	them because it flags errors when in debug mode).
	
	Also, when specifying array values by name use quotes around the
	name
	
	 eg  $array['value'] instead of $array[value]
	
	Finally, I changed the way user restoring works (slightly). 
	Before, if a restored user was found to be a course creator or an
	admin, then this status was restored.  I don't think this is a good
	idea - it could lead to security problems when copying a backup
	from one site to another, or if that person's status has changed
	since the backup was made.  I think it's best to only restore what
	is actually part of the course, ie teacher or student.
	
	If this broke anything else let me know!

2003-08-24 Sunday 18:04  moodler

	* course/category.php:

	OK, this is a new scheme to allow some teachers to edit and others
	to not that is much better than the proposal to change the role of
	course creators.
	
	There is a new field in user_teachers called "editall", which is ON
	BY DEFAULT, and allows teachers to edit courses.  It can be
	modified on the teacher editing screen (formerly assign teachers).
	
	The value is cached in the session.
	
	To test for it, there is a new function isteacheredit($course->id)
	which works much like isteacher did.
	
	I'm going through now and applying this new function wherever it is
	needed.

	WARNING: BIG CHANGES!
	
	OK, this is a big check-in with some big changes, and needs work
	still.
	
	It seems relatively stable, but I need help identifying the rough
	patches.
	
	1) First grading scales support.  There is a now a new table called
	"scale"    that contains grading scales.  There can be site scales
	(course=0) and	  custom course scales.  These can be used in
	modules - I've only done    forums for now but that was the hard
	one.  Scales can be edited via	  the new item in the course admin
	menu.
	
	   There is one default scale - the connected/separate knowing one
	that used
	   to be in forum.  To build this I pull data from the language
	packs
	   to create one during the upgrade, or anytime a scales menu is
	called
	   and no scales are found.
	
	2) New roles for course creator and teachers.  I've fixed up the
	course	  menus and some other things but there's a lot left to do
	on this to    make it all smooth.  The idea is that teachers no
	longer can edit courses    unless they are also course creators. 
	The interface for this needs to    be smoothed out a fair bit and I
	need help with this.
	
	   The upgrade will upgrade all teachers to be creators, but will
	default
	   the new site config "creatornewcourses" to "no", so that
	effectively
	   these new teachers have the same privileges.
	
	3) Simplified teacher management.  There is no longer an "assign
	teachers"    and a "teacher roles" page - it's all on one page in
	course/teacher.html.
	
	Phew ... time for a shower and then back into it.

	lang/en/moodle.php, lang/en/docs/release.html, user/edit.php: 
	
	Another big checkin.
	
	This includes some significant cleanups to the new course
	categories system.  The basic idea is that the categories/course
	browser is now unified under one system, and admin features related
	to that have all been moved into the browser (as little icons).
	
	I'm much happier with this as a foundation that can scale and be
	built upon.
	
	Still to go:
	
	  - searching
	  - paging
	  - polishing
	
	Also in here are a lot of little cleanups around the place, such as
	the initial setup process.

	* admin/site.html: 
	
	Allow site course to have custom words for student and teachers

2003-08-03 Sunday 16:00  kaipe

	* mod/quiz/: attempt.php, lib.php, mod.html, review.php,
	version.php: 
	
	New quiz option - "Each attempt builds on the last" This makes it
	possible for students to take a tedious quiz, save it half-way and
	have it graded. The student can then, at a later point, get back to
	the quiz and have the previous answers already filled in and
	graded. The student can then continue with the remaining questions
	as well as redo all the answers that got wrong at the previous
	attempt.  It seems to work fine with one little twisted exception:
	Say that the student attempts the quiz first and that the teacher
	thereafter edits the quiz and removes or adds a few questions. This
	will work out fine for as long as the teacher do not get the idea
	of adding a question with question type RANDOM. The quiz will be
	fully functional again after removing that RANDOM question or
	resetting the option 'Each attempt builds on the last" to NO.  Not
	a very serious problem but it takes someone with greater insight in
	question type RANDOM to resolve it.
	
	As always, I can not commit lang/en/quiz.php.  --- As I was using
	the function quiz_get_attempt_responses I had it refactored
	removing the obsolete argument $quiz. I also changed the call from
	review.php

2003-08-03 Sunday 15:55  stronk7

	* lib/datalib.php: 
	
	LIMIT is now working properly.

2003-08-03 Sunday 14:39  kaipe

	* mod/quiz/lib.php: 
	
	Resolving bug #576.  This solution shows the message "Recently
	added question!" and the question text for each question that has
	been added since the reviewed attempt.	The advantage with the
	chosen solution is that it will work fine for the (soon to come)
	"Each attempt builds on the last" quiz option.
	
	As I don't have the karma needed for updating in lang/en/, the
	message does not yet look quite as I described it above.

2003-08-03 Sunday 13:02  kaipe

	* mod/quiz/lib.php: 
	
	Debugged question types NUMERICAL and MULTIANSWER (known as
	embedded answers) as these did not do things right whenever a
	student had not given any response (was treated as zero etc).  For
	numerical there was also a need to allow typical shortanswer
	responses whenever there could be answers like n/a, inf, -inf, nan
	etc.  Further more about numerical, there can be more than one
	answer alternative defined (just like for shortanswer). This is not
	supported by numerical.html but everywhere else. MULTIANSWER
	included, it is up to any taker to update numerical.html. This is
	more than likely to lead to overlappings between numerical ranges
	if more than one is defined. Think of the case where the highest
	grade answer ranges between 0 and 2 and the half grade answer
	ranges between 2 and 4. How should we grade 2? We should pick the
	highest grade!

2003-08-03 Sunday 10:33  mits

	Forget delete some debug, sorry. :-)

2003-08-03 Sunday 09:36  stronk7

	* mod/quiz/restorelib.php: 
	
	Now, when a category exists, if we are restoring to a different
	course, set utomatically the publish field to 1.  If a question
	exists in DB (by category, questiontext and qtype) it isn't
	duplicated.  This produce some problems restoring answes, but avoid
	duplicates.

	There is a groovy front end for managing these, and a better range
	of options for formatting the front page.
	
	It all still needs some polishing, which I'll be doing over the
	next couple of days, including better auto-sorting.
	
	I would not use this on production systems just yet.

	New version of help.php that automatically constructs the
	index.html and mods.html files.
	
	Direct from Mad Alex

2003-07-24 Thursday 05:09  moodler

	* admin/modules.php: 
	
	If modules have a config.php file in them then a link to this is
	printed in the modules screen.
	
	These config.php screens presumably allow the setting of site-wide
	parameters for modules.
	
	Thanks to Mad Alex. :-)

	* admin/user.php: 
	
	YES!!!	FINALLY fixed that damn bug that was causing the admin user
	to be skipped during installation!
	
	Bug 565 has the details, but basically it was caused by not
	initialising the variable $user before using it.  Some people
	probably had a cookie called "user" that was polluting the
	variable.
	
	YAY!

	New modular plugin structure for quiz reports.
	
	The code for reviewing an existing attempt is now separate in
	review.php and now has a log entry of it's own.
	
	The overview and regrade reports are now in separate subdirectories
	under the "report" directory.  Each has a primary "report.php" file
	which implements the report as a class.
	
	These existing reports are very simple, but now more complex ones
	can easily be written.	(I am about to do one).

	* lib/datalib.php: 
	
	Add LIMIT of 1 to get_record functions ... the behaviour of
	returning false when there were more than one record returned was
	sometimes causing problems if the data was unclean due to a bug
	somewhere.
	
	For example, if there are two copies of a section, then Moodle
	keeps creating new ones because it can't find ONE.  This fix
	prevents that.
