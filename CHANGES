	mod/forum/search.php, mod/forum/subscribers.php,
	mod/forum/view.php, user/edit.php, user/lib.php: 
	Widespread changes throughout Moodle to make sure it works on
	servers that have register_globals turned off (this is the default
	setting on newer version of PHP).
	
	In fact it's partly a hack that globalises all GET, POST, FILES AND
	COOKIE variables.  Unfortunately though the SESSION and USER global
	session variables are only available as $_SESSION["USER"] and
	$_SESSION["SESSION"], which is cumbersome to use.
	
	So, for every request I now make a copy of these two session
	variables into $USER and $SESSION.  Whenever I update them
	thoughout Moodle I now have to call save_session("USER") which
	copies them back to the session variable.  This seems to be working
	well now.
	
	Because I'm using $_SESSION etc now this will raise the required
	minimum version of PHP to 4.1.0

2002-08-06 Tuesday 20:58  martin

2002-08-06 Tuesday 20:17  martin

	* mod/forum/lib.php: Whoops ... make sure rated posts still show

2002-08-06 Tuesday 14:09  martin

	* mod/forum/lib.php: forum_print_discussion now checks to see
	whether there are any ratings that haven't been done yet on a
	discussion.  If not, then it won't print the ratings form.  This
	avoids a slight confusion about the interface that existed
	previously.

	mod/reading/version.php, mod/survey/module.php,
	mod/survey/version.php, user/view.php: OK, some massive changes
	with many files removed or changed.
	
	Basically the changes are:
	
	 - I've merged the 'discuss' module into the forum module
	   which makes the interface MUCH clearer for everyone
	 - I've added a new 'single' forum type that replicates
	   what the old discuss course modules used to look like.
	 - I've got rid of the "discussion" forum type - it will
	   still exist in upgraded courses but as a normal forum.
	 - the 'discuss' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - the 'chat' module is completely deleted - gone.
	 - The upgrading system has been improved, and all code
	   is stored in version.php.
	 - I've put in upgrading commands to do the best I can
	   (right now) to upgrade courses that used the discuss
	   module.  It should mostly work, just leaving some
	   "orphan" coursemodules on you course front page.  You
	   can easily delete these using the little 'x'.
	   I may have forgotten something  - I've only tested on
	   my testing server and I'm about to test on my production
	   server to see how it goes.
	 - Forums have a lot of little new features and fixes.	The
	   main one is the subscription process.  Teachers can 'force'
	   subscriptions on any forum.	This disallows everyone from
	   choosing their own mail subscription - it's just on.
	 - The assignment module is half-finished and not working yet
	
	I've still some massive changes to do, mostly involving making all
	the lib.php function names more standardised, so consider this is
	an interim checkin to do some tests.

	* config-dist.php, user/edit.php, user/lib.php: Changes to support
	GD 1 and GD 2.	Well, to be more accurate, we now rely on the
	administrator to tell us which is installed because PHP is not
