This files describes API changes for question type plugins.

=== 2.2 ===

* The XML import/export base class has had some minor API changes. The
  - write_combined_feedback method now requires that you pass the questionid and
    contextid. (MDL-29058)
  - calls to the import_hints and import_answer methods now should pass the question
    text format as the last argument, to be used as a default if necessary. (MDL-29739)
  If you do not upgrade your code, it will not break, but there will be PHP
  warnings, and it the export will not work 100% correctly.

* Question type plugins should start using a string called 'pluginname' for the
  question type name, as with other plugins. Using a string with the same name
  as the question type (e.g. get_string('essay', 'qtype_essay') will be supported
  for one more release, but will generate a debugging warning.
