This files describes API changes for question type plugins.

=== 2.2 ===

* The old
    public function requires_qtypes()
method is no more. Instead use the ->dependencies facility in version.php. E.g.
$plugin->dependencies = array(
    'qtype_numerical' => 2011102700,
);

* The plugin name and related strings used to be defined in language strings
called the same thing as the format, for example:

$string['addingdescription'] = 'Adding a Description';
$string['description'] = 'Description';
$string['description_help'] = 'A description is not really a question type. It simply enables text to be displayed without requiring any answers, similar to a label on the course page.
$string['description_link'] = 'A description is not really a question type. It simply enables text to be displayed without requiring any answers, similar to a label on the course page.
$string['descriptionsummary'] = 'This is not actually a question. Instead it is a way to add some instructions, rubric or other content to the activity. This is similar to the way that labels can be used to add content to the course page.';
$string['editingdescription'] = 'Editing a Description';

All these need to be changed to use the standard string name pluginname, as for
other plugin types, and similar for the other strings.

$string['pluginname'] = 'Description';
$string['pluginname_help'] = 'A description is not really a question type. It simply enables text to be displayed without requiring any answers, similar to a label on the course page.
$string['pluginname_link'] = 'A description is not really a question type. It simply enables text to be displayed without requiring any answers, similar to a label on the course page.
$string['pluginnameadding'] = 'Adding a Description';
$string['pluginnameediting'] = 'Editing a Description';
$string['pluginnamesummary'] = 'This is not actually a question. Instead it is a way to add some instructions, rubric or other content to the activity. This is similar to the way that labels can be used to add content to the course page.';

The old strings will continue to work, but only until Moodle 2.3 is released.
