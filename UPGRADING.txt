UPGRADING   $Id$
---------

As Moodle grows, there are changes to the code and 
sometimes changes to the database structures.

Moodle is able to upgrade its own databases, using 
information in files called version.php.  There is 
one of these for the main tables (in this directory)
and one for each module.

When upgrading from any previous version of Moodle, 
all you normally will need to do is this:

1)  Make a backup of your current Moodle installation 
    in the unlikely case that something goes wrong and 
    you need to restore the older version.

2a) If you are using CVS, just go the root directory
    and type "cvs update -d" (or whatever the equivalent
    is on your non-Unix server).

                       OR

2b) Remove the current installation, and then unpack 
    the new tar or zip file in the same location.
    Make sure you copy the config.php file from your 
    old installion to the new installation (or make a 
    new one by editing config-dist.php).

3)  Visit the home page of your installation while logged
    in as an admin.  Moodle will automatically detect the 
    new version and perform any database upgrades that 
    might be necessary.

If all goes well (no error messages) then you can just 
go on using Moodle normally.

If you have problems with this procedure, let me know.

Cheers,
Martin
