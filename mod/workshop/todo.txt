To Do
=====

Use a better method to measure bias in peer grades, probably based on the
	percentage difference rather the relative difference used at present.

Add time-agreed test to calculation of final grades.

Comments are seen by a third party, is this standard Moodle behaviour?

Cron function should email something to the assessor when an assessment is
	agreed.
	
Self assessments may need special handling, remove duplication in student 
	view
