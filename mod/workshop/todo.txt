To Do
=====

Use a better method to measure bias in peer grades, probably based on the
	percentage difference rather the relative difference used at present.

When there are many peer gradings the grade comments page needs to be
	broken into manageable chunks. **DONE**

Allow teacher to add a set of submissions (from say a previous cohort) for the
	students to grade. **Probably better as a separate module**
	
Add option to allow the teacher's grade and mean peer grade to be merged in
	the final grades table (to avoid disputes!).

Add alternative grading strategies: Simple Grading (= assignment style grading);
	Accumulative Grading (current strategy); Criteria Grading; and Error Banding.
