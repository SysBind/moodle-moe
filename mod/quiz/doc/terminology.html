<p>

In order to describe and understand the quiz module, it is necessary to
understand the terminology that is used to describe its aspects. On this page
the important terms are named and explained and in some cases linked to more
detailed documentation.

        <td>The term answer is used exclusively for the teacher defined answers
        of a question. These answers are usually stored in the
        <code>quiz_answers</code> table and are compared to the responses for
        grading.

        <td>The term attempt is used in the sense of "Attempt at the quiz".
        Depending on the quiz settings, a student may be allowed several
        attempts at a quiz. An attempt is finished when the student clicks on
        the corresponding button on the attempt page. Students do not have to
        complete an attempt in one visit. They can navigate away from
        the quiz page and return later to continue the same attempt.<br />
        Within one and the same quiz attempt a student may make several attempts
        at answering a particular question, at least if the questiontype allows
        it and the quiz is set up in adaptive mode. These will always be 
        referred to as &quot;attempts at a question&quot;, never just as
        &quot;attempts&quot;.

        <td>There are several questiontypes built into the quiz module, however,
        due to the plugin architecture of the quiz module, it is possible to
        define custom questiontypes. Existing questiontypes include true/false,
        multiple choice, short answer, numerical and  calculated questions.

        <td>Conceptually these are the students' responses to a question. This
        is always used in plural, although for some questiontypes there is only
        one possible response. In the runtime <code>$state</code> object there
        is a field <code>$state-&gt;responses</code>, which holds an array of a
        student's responses to a question.
