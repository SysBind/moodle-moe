<p>

In order to describe and understand the quiz module, it is necessary to
understand the terminology that is used to describe its aspects. On this page
the important terms are named and explained and in some cases linked to more
detailed documentation.

        </td>
        <td>Adaptive questions are questions that walk the user through a
        directed graph of question states depending on the user's responses.
        E.g. a complicated mathematical question that is answered incorrectly,
        but is likely to be incorrect because of a common mistake, could provide
        the user with a hint towards this mistake, apply a penalty and allow a
        second attempt at this question.<br />
        Quizzes can be run in adaptive mode, which provides buttons to mark each
        question individually.

        <td>The term answer is used exclusively for the teacher defined answers
        of a question. These answers are usually stored in the
        <code>quiz_answers</code> table and are compared to the responses for
        grading.

    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><a name="#attempts"></a>attempt(s)</td>
        <td>The term attempt is used in the sense of "Attempt at the quiz".
        Depending on the quiz settings, a student may be allowed several
        attempts at a quiz. An attempt is finished when the student clicks on
        the corresponding button on the attempt page. Students do not have to
        complete an attempt in one visit. They can navigate away from
        the quiz page and return later to continue the same attempt.<br />
        Within one and the same quiz attempt a student may make several attempts
        at answering a particular question, at least if the questiontype allows
        it and the quiz is set up in adaptive mode. These will always be
        referred to as &quot;attempts at a question&quot;, never just as
        &quot;attempts&quot;.

    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><a name="#event"></a>event</td>
        <td>The $stateobject (and the <code>quiz_states</code> table) has a
        field <code>event</code>, which indicates the event that led to the
        creation of the state. The field can take the value of any of the
        following constants (defined in locallib.php):
        <ul>
          <li>EVENTOPEN: The attempt has just been opened and this is the
          initial state of a question, i.e. the user has seen the question did
          not interact with it yet.</li>
          <li>EVENTSAVE: The responses are just being saved, either because the
          student requested this explicitly or because the student navigated to
          another quiz page.</li>
          <li>EVENTVALIDATE: The student requested a validation of the
          responses. (This is not supported by all questiontypes.)</li>
          <li>EVENTGRADE: The responses are being graded but the question
          session is not closed. This is generally the case for adaptive
          questions.</li>
          <li>EVENTCLOSE: The responses are being graded and the question
          session is closed. Usually this happens because the whole attempt
          closes, either because the student requests it or because the time is
          up or because we are beyond the due date.</li>
          <li>EVENTDUPLICATEGRADE: This is a strange one. It indicates that the
          responses would have been graded had they not been found to be
          identical to previous responses.</li>
        </ul>
        When new responses are being processed by the function <code>
        quiz_process_responses</code>, then this function is being passed the
        event type in <code>$action->event</code> while the responses are in
        <code>$action->responses</code>.

        <td>Strictly, a question in the context of the quiz module is the set of
        definitions (question name, question text, possible answers, feedback,
        etc.) that constitute a reusable item. Therefore a question itself is a
        static entity. All data related to interactions with a particular
        question (in a particular attempt on a particular quiz) is stored in its
        corresponding states.

        multiple choice, short answer, numerical and  calculated questions.

        one possible response. In the runtime <code>$state</code> object there
        is a field <code>$state-&gt;responses</code>, which holds an array of a
        student's responses to a question.

        States always "belong" to a question within a particular attempt and are
        therefore also user specific. The first state in a question's life cycle
        during an attempt records the fact that the user has seen the question.
        This state is never modified, however, it can be superseded by a new
        state, which represents a user interaction. Different user interactions
        are defined by the events, a set of constants, one
        for each possible type of user interaction.
