<p align="center"><b>Penalty</b></p>

<p>You can specify what fraction of the achieved score should be subtracted for each wrong attempt. This is only relevant if the quiz is run in adaptive mode so that the student is allowed to have several attempts at the question. The penalty should be a number between 0 and 1. A penalty of 1 means that the student has to get the answer right on the first attempt to get any credit for it at all.</p>
