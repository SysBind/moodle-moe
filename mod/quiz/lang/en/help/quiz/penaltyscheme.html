<p align="center"><b>Penalty scheme</b></p>

<p>If a question allows a student to have repeated attempts then the question may impose a penalty for wrong attempts.
This penalty is a number between 0 and 1 and denotes the fraction of the final score that should be deducted as a penalty.
If the student makes several wrong attempts then the penalties for the individual attempts are combined before
being used to calculate the final grade.</p>
