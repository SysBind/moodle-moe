<p align="center"><b>Allow adaptive questions</b></p>

<p>If you choose Yes for this option then an additional <?php print_string('mark', 'quiz') ?> button is shown for each question.
If the student presses this button then the answer to that particular question is submitted to be scored and the mark achieved 
is displayed to the student. If the question is an adaptive question then it is displayed in its new state that takes the
student's answer into account and will in many cases ask the student for another input. In the simplest adaptive questions 
this new state may differ only in the feedback text and prompt the student to try again; in more
complicated question also the question text and even the interaction elements can change.
</p>

<p>For most adaptive questions the student will be able to interact with a single question repeatedly until he gets the right answer.
However a penalty will usually be subtracted from the students score for each wrong attempt. This is under the teacher's control.
The question may also close itself to new attempts. For example true/false questions will not allow
the student to answer again after the first attempt because the answer would be obvious.</p>
