# On some PHP servers it may help if this file is copied
# to the main moodle directory and renamed .htaccess
#
# As soon as you do this, check your web site.  Is it 
# still working OK?  If you are getting a "configuration
# error" then you may need to enable overrides by editing
# the main httpd.conf for Apache and in the main server
# or virtual server area, adding something like:
#
# <Directory /web/moodle>
#     AllowOverride All 
# </Directory>
#
### Firstly, set up some PHP variables that Moodle needs

php_value magic_quotes_gpc 1
php_value file_uploads 1
php_value short_open_tag 1
php_value session.auto_start 0


### These are optional - you may not want to override php.ini 

#php_value upload_max_filesize 2M
#php_value post_max_size 2M


### Optional definition of default files

#DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm


### Change the following line to point to the error/index.php
### file in your Moodle distribution.  It provides a form 
### which emails you (the admin) about 404 errors.

#ErrorDocument 404 http://example.org/moodle/error/index.php
