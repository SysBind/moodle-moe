# On some PHP servers it may help if this file is copied
# to the main moodle directory and renamed .htaccess
#
# As soon as you do this, check your web site.  Is it 
# still working OK?  If you are getting a "configuration
# error" then you may need to enable overrides by editing
# the main httpd.conf for Apache and in the main server
# or virtual server area, adding something like:
#
# <Directory /web/moodle>
#     AllowOverride All 
# </Directory>
#

### Firstly, if you are using Apache 2, you need the following
### three lines to allow Apache to pass a PATH_INFO variable 
### correctly for URLs like http://server/file.php/arg1/arg2

<IfDefine APACHE2>
    AcceptPathInfo on
</IfDefine>

### Secondly, you can define the default files in the Moodle
### directories as follows:

DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm

### Thirdly, set up some PHP variables that Moodle needs

php_value magic_quotes_gpc On
php_value magic_quotes_runtime Off   
php_value file_uploads On
php_value short_open_tag On
php_value session.auto_start Off
php_value session.bug_compat_warn Off


### These are optional - you may not want to override php.ini 
### To enable them, remove the leading hash (#)

#php_value upload_max_filesize 2M
#php_value post_max_size 2M
#php_value session.gc_maxlifetime 7200


### You can change the following line to point to the 
### error/index.php file in your Moodle distribution.  
### It provides a form which emails you (the admin) 
### about 404 errors (URL not found).

#ErrorDocument 404 http://example.org/moodle/error/index.php
