Once databases exist, Moodle should support a wide
variety of databases (because it uses the ADODB library).

Unfortunately, database differences still means that 
the *creation* of the databases is very different.

This directory (and the db directory in each module) 
contains SQL code for creating Moodle databases on 
each type of database.
