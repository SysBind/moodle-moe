This version of the Richtext editor started out as 0.3 beta 1,
and I've hacked richedit.html to make the toolbars more compact.

I've also changed the smilies to refer to Moodle smilies, and 
added/removed some.

I've just added and further hacked some changes from Janne 
Mikkonen (http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=2126)
to allow a popup so that images can be selected from the 
course files area.

This includes these PHP files in this folder:

 -- courseimages.php
 -- dlg_ins_image.php
 -- richedit.php
 -- rte.php
