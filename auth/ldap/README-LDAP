LDAP-module README
07.10.2002 Version 0.1, Petri Asikainen <paca@sci.fi>

Ldap-authetication module is work in progress. 
Right now we are building config-interface to use also with all other auth-modules, 
but it will take sometime.

If you like to try ldap-authentication now , create following $CFG->variables to
/moodle/config.php or directly to config-table and activate ldap authentication 
from admin-configuration page.

Variable			Description
$CFG->ldap_bind_dn      	"If your like to use bind-user to search
				users, specify it here. Something like 
				'cn=ldapuser,ou=public,o=org'"
$CFG->ldap_bind_pw      	"Password for bind-user."
$CFG->ldap_contexts    		"List of contexts where users are located.
				 Separate different contexts with ';'.
				Something like 
				'ou=users,o=org; ou=other,o=org'"
$CFG->ldap_host_url      	"Specify LDAP host in URL-form, like
				'ldap://ldap.myorg.com/' or 
				'ldaps//ldap.myorg.com/' "
$CFG->ldap_search_sub   	"Put value <> 0 if  you like to 
				search users from subcontexts. 
				(Subsearching is sometimes slow)"
$CFG->ldap_user_attribute 	"What attribute is used to name/search
				users. Usually 'cn' when using 
				Novell e-directory
$CFG->ldap_objectclass		When filtering objects from ldap this filter is used
				defaults to "objectClass=*"

And if you like to _very_ experimental:
Edit /auth/ldap/lib.php function auth_get_userinfo() attribute-mappings and
set $CFG->auth_update_userinfo = 1
Then moodle will get user first-, lastname and other information from ldap
when user is login first time.
